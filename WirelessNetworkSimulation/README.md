We connect the devices and add a laptop.

We add the device named AP-PT to our topology and connect it via port 0 to any port on the switch.

Left-click on the laptop you added to the topology and select the WPC300N device from the window that opens.
Then, turn off the laptop from area #1.
Drag the device from area #2 to area #3.
Turn on your laptop by clicking on area number 1.

Click on the Access Point device named AP-PT, and in the window that opens (as shown in the image), go to the Config tab and click on the Port 1 field.

Enter AP-2026 in the SSID field. In the Authentication field, select WPA-PSK as the encryption type. Enter AP-20266 as the password.
(NOTE: Do not use the same SSID and password, and they don't have to be exactly as shown in the image; you can change them.)
(The AP device name can be changed from the global>settings section in the same window.)
